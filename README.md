# arduino-dcc-generate
Arduino-based project to generate DCC timing signals from network or serial-based DCC packets

The intent is to enable a total software-based command station which can generate DCC packets and use an Arduino-based device to generate a properly timed DCC signal to drive a DCC booster.  The hope is to enable the rapid development and enhancement of a 100% software DCC ocmmand station rather than being tied to the development and release cycles of the hardware-based DCC vendors.
